		<h2>Project Experiences</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Qingjiang <em>EDC</em></li>
			<p>This is a project about economic dispatch control of Cascade Hydropower Plants. What I do for this project is electric power load short-term prediction of cascade hydropower plants.</p>
			<li>R-G <em>Cascade Reservoirs Optimized Dispatch</em> Analysis</li>
			<p>This one is also a project about dispatch of Cascade Hydropower Plants. However, different from the last one, it is a long term analysis for plants' dispatch. I study dispatch graph for cascade plants and propose a novel method to make optimal dispatch graph which has remarkable effect for cascade reservoirs power generation.</p>
			<li><em>Flood hazard map</em> in Jingjiang river reach</li>
			<p>This is a flood control project. When flood in river can't be prevented by dams, the flood diversion and storage area near the river will be used. The question is whether or not we should use the area, So how to evaluate the loss caused by leding flood to the area is a big problem which is what I do in this task.</p>
